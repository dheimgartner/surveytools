# surveytools

This package brings the `SurveyJS` library to R. It allows you to construct surveys programmatically (i.e. from within R) and layer by layer. Further, testing in the Viewer is as simple as printing the survey object. If you are happy with the result, easily implement it in RShiny and dynamically get answers sent to your RSession.

Not as powerful as **Qualtrics** though! ;)
